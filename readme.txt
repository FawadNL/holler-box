Here's how you can use Holler Box to get more leads and sales:

### 1. Increase Your Email Opt-ins

Step one is to collect more leads at the top of your funnel, so you can follow up with customers and potentially convert them into customers.

Holler Box allows you to create email optin forms easily, choose where and when to display them, and integrate with your email provider. Using the Holler Box smart display filters, you can show your opt-in in the right place at the right time, to increase your conversion rates and eventually get more sales.

Use Holler Box to announce a webinar, a live event, or get traffic to a new article. It's flexible so you can get your message across.

### 2. Increase Sales

Holler Box Pro has a couple of ways to increase your sales.

**Announce Promotions with the Holler Banner (pro only)**

When you are running a sale or promotion on your store, you want the right people to know about it to get as many sales as possible. Use the Holler Banner to show your promotion or discount code in a header banner on your site, and automatically deactivate it when the promotion ends.

Using the Holler Box smart display filters, you can choose to show the promotion only to logged out visitors, not to any logged in customers.

**FOMO popups (pro only)**

Social proof is a big part of converting a potential sale. If are using WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads, now you can show your customers that other people are buying with the Holler Box Sales Notification add-on.

It displays the name and package purchased by your latest customer to anyone who visits your site. Choose where and when to show it, for example only once per visitor per day.

Watch your conversion rates skyrocket with this amazing social proof!

### 3. Gather Feedback

An important part of any eCommerce store is gathering feedback from site visitors.

Using the expanded pop-out option (pro only), you can ask for feedback using an embedded Gravity Form. This allows you to tweak and optimize your site based on real input from your potential customers.

### Conversion data and more

Get conversion data right in your admin to see how well your messages are working, so you can tweak and improve. 

Add any WordPress content such as shortcodes and media, and feel secure knowing you own your own data. No 3rd party services are displaying your popups with Holler Box.

The best part about Holler Box is that it is effective with being annoying. It shows your audience the right message at the right time, without turning people off.

## What can you do with it?

**Popups**

Show popups to collect more email subscribers. Choose from the free templates, or get Pro for more options.

**Smart notification box**

Show a non-intrusive Intercom style notification box with your message. Announce a webinar, collect email optins, show your latest blog post, and lots more.

Choose where and when you show it, and to which visitors. For example, show your sale announcement only on the pricing page to returning visitors. Show your email optin only on your blog posts.

**(Fake) Live Chat with Opt-in**

If you like Drift, Intercom, or Show a live chat box to collect customer questions and emails, without having to actually deal with the hassle of live chat! As soon as your visitor types a question, an email opt-in pops up so you can follow up with them at a convenient time.

**Polls and Forms**

Embed anything into your Holler Box, including a feedback form or poll.

**Impressions and Conversions**

See how your messages are performing. Track views and conversions (link clicks and message opens) so you can optimize and improve. 

**Interactivity**

Add a link, video, contact form, or simple opt-in form that integrates with major email providers like MailChimp and Convertkit.

Read more about what's in Pro.

**Content Upgrades**

Content upgrades are a proven technique to get more email subscribers.

The way it works is by adding a link in one of your blog posts that opens a popup with a free bonus.

Holler Box Pro makes it easy to add content upgrades. All you need to do is select “content upgrade” in the settings and paste the shortcode into any post or page.

**More Popup Templates**

Get even more popup templates for your store in Pro. Choose from a variety of templates to get the look you want, and get new ones as they come out.

**Easy Digital Downloads and WooCommerce Sales Notifications**

Easily show your site visitors a notification like: "Matt just purchased Holler Box Pro." This sales notification pulls the latest sale from EDD or WooCommerce.

Also known as FOMO popups, these can increase your conversion rate by showing social proof.

**Holler Banner**

Holler Box Pro adds an option for a smart header banner with the same powerful user filtering. It works great when you have a limited time sale, or a very important announcement.

**Expanded Option**

Have more than just a quick message to show? The expanded option allows you to add a button that opens to a larger view with whatever content you want.

**Set It and Forget It**

The set it and forget it feature allows you to automatically deactivate your Holler Boxes on a certain date. If you are having a limited time sale, set your Holler Box to stop showing automatically when the sale ends.

**Smarter Show-On Filters**

The Pro version also includes more advanced show on filtering, so it’s easier to deploy your boxes only on certain site pages. For example, show your Holler Box on certain blog categories, tags, post types, and more.

== FAQ ==

*Does it use the wp_mail() function to send mail?* 

Yes, if you have an SMTP plugin like Postman, Mailgun, or other mail plugin it will automatically use that to send mail.

*How do I setup MailChimp?*

First, add your API key under Holler Box => Settings.

You can find your API key in your MailChimp account under Account => Extras => API Keys. Generate a new one if it doesn't exist.

Save your API key.

Next, in your Holler Box, choose Mailchimp as the opt-in provider. Add your list ID. You can find this under Lists => Your List => Settings => List name and defaults. Look on the right side of the screen for List ID.

Copy/paste that into the MailChimp list ID field and save.

<strong>How do I find my Convertkit form ID and API key?</strong>

Your API key is on your account page.

To get your form ID, visit Forms => your form. Look in the browser address bar, it should be something like this:

https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/445667/edit

That number is the form ID, in this case it's 445667. Enter that number as the Convertkit form ID.

*How do I setup MailPoet?*

Install MailPoet, version 3 or later. Create a new Holler Box, and select MailPoet as the email provider. Choose your list and save, new subscribers will be added to this list.

**Troubleshooting**

*Emails are not sending*

The wp_mail() function is unreliable on many hosts. Install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/" target="_blank">Postman</a> or another SMTP plugin to use a more reliable mail service.

*Email signups are not working* 

Make sure your email form does not have a required field that is not displayed. For example, if you required first and last name, it will not work. Change your form to only require email, the rest of the fields optional. If you need extra fields, use the custom HTML form option.
